# bulk_firebase_importer

Bulk Firebase Importer is flutter desktop app which was developed to upload the data from a csv file to firestore databases in batches. I've personally written 1,85,000 firebase database from a csv file with it and now I made it open source.

## Getting Started

It is a Flutter Project. Just Clonse the git repository and run the project and it will show you all the steps to follow automatically.
